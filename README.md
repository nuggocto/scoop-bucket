# Scoop bucket

Personal [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) bucket for Nuggocto projects and release
artifacts.

## Usage

The bucket name is local to each machine. These examples use `nuggocto` so the
same bucket can hold multiple apps.

```powershell
scoop bucket add nuggocto https://github.com/nuggocto/scoop-bucket
scoop install kickoutchi
```

Installs both `kickoutchi.exe` and `kick.exe` from the release's
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` archive. Windows on ARM is not shipped (x64 only).

## Packages

| Manifest | Project |
| --- | --- |
| `kickoutchi` | https://github.com/nuggocto/kickoutchi |

More manifests can be added under `bucket/*.json` as other projects publish
Scoop releases.

## Repository Setup

This repository is the canonical Scoop bucket. GitHub Actions must be enabled
with **Read and write permissions** so Excavator can commit manifest updates with
the repo's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## How updates happen

Each manifest can carry `checkver` and `autoupdate` entries so Excavator can
watch upstream GitHub releases, regenerate versions, URLs, and hashes, then
commit the update. The workflow runs every four hours and can also be dispatched
manually.

To test a manifest change before pushing:

```powershell
scoop install ./bucket/kickoutchi.json
scoop uninstall kickoutchi
```
